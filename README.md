# Overview

Curandera is a pythono library that makes working with the [CMake File API][1]
easier. It provides an API for configuring and building a CMake project
programmatically, while also allowing for introspection of the build (upon
successful project configuration)

## Why the name?

A curandera is traditionally a medicine woman in mexican culture. The are closely related to Bruja's in that they practice "witchcraft" (i.e., *brujeria*), but with the intent of healing others.

Curandera is a key component for the [brujeria][2] tool, and allows us to abstract specific CMake logic away and *demystify* the black magic of CMake's "code model"
